INTRODUCTION We are happy to present by the grace of God this edition of the Brihat Samhita of Sri Varahamihira with an English translation. A look at the table of contents will enable the reader to gauge the wonderful depth and wide range of the author’s knowledge- In this monu¬ mental work which can rightly be called a Magnum Opus, there is no subject which he has not treated of with dignity, beauty and grandeur. This work, in fine, is a valuable encyclopaedia, as it deals with an astonish¬ ing variety of subjects of exceptional interest and value. Albiruni, the Arabian astronomer who has translated the (Laghu Jataka) of our author into Arabic, eulogises this (Samhita) for its richness in details. It contains important astronomical data, geographical details, Architecture, Sculpture, Medicine, Psychology, Physiology, Physiognomy, Botany, Zoology, Prosody, figures of speech and other subjects. This work is un¬ ique in Sanskrit Literature. The author has made it extremely interesting in spite of its dealing with technical subjects. The author is a poet of a high order. We can also observe here clear traces of the influence of the great poet Kalidasa on this author. In fact (Varahamihira) must have been an ardent admirer of Kalidasa. This fact probably led people to believe that our author was a contemporary of the illustrious poet. Moreover, in the (Jyotirvidabharana), its author, a Kalidasa, says that he wrote it in 3068 of Kali Yuga or 33 b. c. and that he is a contemporary of Varahamihira. This work bears internal testimony of IV composition at a much later date. This pseudo-Kali¬ dasa apparently wanted to pass off for the real one and called himself a contemporary of V^arahainihir.i- Varaha- miliir i’s literary acknowledi^incnt to Kalidasa will be apparent from the following- extracts : — ^(nr (Brihatsamhita LXX-23) ar't: ?ifrT(«ofg;iia?n fs (Brihatsamhita II-2) ft *T (Rrihat Samhita LXXIV-5) RHf sTma nars?tatcflr (Brihat Samhita LXXV-3) -ns'l ^nfd H Brihat Samhita LXXV-4) and verses 7 and 8 (The whole chapter is excellent) «ar 1} (Brihat Samhita LXXVl 11-14) The verses I and 2 in Adhyaya L.XXIV, All these lead us to believe in the author’s admira¬ tion for Kalidasa. The metres employed by him point to his mastery of poetics and command of language. He gives various kinds of (Dandaka) and w«i’f (Ary as). The author is a staunch adherent of scientific princi¬ ples in Astrology. Out of respect for the ancient sages or masters of this science, he quotes their views and then slates his own confirmed decisions in unmistakable terms {oidaWl’l, 2, V-1.17, and IX-Gj. He belongs to the group of first-rank scholars in scientific astronomy such as Mi fw? (Aryabhata: ; sraH (Brahmagupta) and (Bhadtara). [The last two are posterior to him]. Varaha- mihira does not claim to be a pioneer in the field of Samhita. Before him, Parasara, Garga and others had V written Samhitas. He refers to them and sometimes quotes them an;l qives his views in addition, for the benefit of mankind {vide 1-5). The 'TffJi/a*? fParasara Tantra) is [)arlly in prose and partly in verse of I'Anushtub) and (Arya) type- The geographical details given in diapier XIV are taken with slight changes from this (Tantra), So, it can be said to be the geography of India at the lime of Parasara- According to tradition, it was Varaharnihira that fixed the sphere at the beginning of Aswini (C/. III-l). His style, though at times archaic, is simple, grace¬ ful and pithy, bearing the stamp of individuality and affinity to (Siisrula) and Kalidasa, That is the reason why he was ranked among the nine gems of the Court of Vikrama, The author was the son of fAdityadasa) of Ujjain (f. ar. XXVI11-9). The Astronomers of Ujjain have held that (Vantha) belonged to the 427th year of Saka era or 505 A- D, This date is confirmed by Albi- runi also as that of the composition of his (Pancha Siddhaniika). But Dr. Bhau Daji declares that (Varatia) died in 587 A. D. Hence it should be concluded that 50o a. d. is the date of his birth and not of his composition. Scholars hold that (Varalia) quotes wJaz (Aryabhata) who was born in 476 A. D. This also points to the above conclusion regarding the date of his birth. About the statement made in the (Jyotirvidabharana) we can only say that it was not written by Kalidasa, the author of Raghu- vamsa, etc. IVobably there were many Kalidasas and one such was the one belonging to the 6th century a. d. Vi For, the (Satrunjayamahatmya) mentions a king (Vikramaditya) as having ascended the throne in 544 A. D- Probably (Varaha) and this neo Kalidasa were contemporaries of this Vikrama. Similarly wwJt'&g’ (Amarasimha) who is identified with (Amaradeva) that built the Buddha Gaya temple in about 500 a. d. is said to be a contemporary of our author- This too will lead to the above conclusion of his date. Many scholars from the days of Colebrook, Davis, Sir William Jones, Weber and Lassen have done much research work on Varahamihira- According te Sage Garga, the Science of Astronomy- cum-Astrology was created by the creator himself for the sake of the twice-born as ancillary to the Vedas. It was handed down to Garga by Brahman, and from him, other sages got it and thus its knowledge was dissem- nated throughout the world. It is but right that we draw here the attention of the readers to the erroneous judgment of many a wes¬ tern orientalist regarding Astrology and Greek influence. On the other hand, it is the Greeks who freely borrowed or learnt the various scientific truths from the Aryans of India. Clement of Alexandria calls Pythagoras, the celebrated (ireek, a pupil of the Brahmanas. The Swami Vivekananda, the great spiritual and intellectual giant of modern India, has ably refuted the false theories of the Western Orientalists- He says :— “There may be, it is true some similarity between the Greek and Indian terms in astronomy and so forth, but the westerners have ignored the direct Sanskrit etymology and sought for some far-fetched etymology from the Greek. That vii such shallow and biased learning has been manifested by many orientalists in the West is deplorable. From a single Sanskrit Sloka that reads, ‘ The Yavanas are Mlechchas; in them, this Science is established ; therefore, even they deserve worship like Kishis.’ in the west, they have gone so far as to declare that all Indian sciences are but echoes of the Greek ; whereas a true reading of the Sloka may show that the Mlechcha disciples of the Aryans are herein praised in order to encourage them to a further study of the Aryan Sciences. Onlv a sage can comprehened this Science, says our author (11-4). The present author docs pay homage to the ancient authorities on this subject. He also just alludes to the various theories regarding creation pro¬ pounded by the Sankhyas, Vaiseshikas, Meemamsakas and others and passes on to the subject on hand \ The Science consists of three Skandhas or branches, viz, Ganita, Hora and Sakha {viile 1-9). The treatment of the whole subject in all its details is said to be (Samhita) which itself means a collection. Accordingly Garga says that the Great Brahman who is well-versed in these three branches is said to be an expert in Sam¬ hita, But our author points out that he has already done justice to two of the branches, m., Ganita and Jataka (5irai«) in his (Panchasiddhantika) and (Brihat Jataka) respectively {vide I-IO). He gives in the 2nd Chapter the details of the (Sam- hita) thereby indicating that the term Samhita is inde¬ pendently used for the Sakha also by itself. But he gives a resume of the first two Skandhas also. It has been stated (CVll-13) that this work consists of 100 Adhyayas, in Slokas 3900 when converted into viii (Anushtub) metre- Out of the 107 Adhyayas now printed in this book, the chapters on (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) 5fm5E and (7) 5ir?^rg^‘i<nr are apparently not his. These have been noted in tlieir respective places. The qualifications of an astrologer (Adh. II) are really very high and not within easy reach of ordinary mortals. The author says that a king should employ a chief astrologer assisted by 4 others. He is of opinion that no j;ood people should live in a country where there are no good astrologers. The esteem in which the author holds them is indeed very great. He is equally strong in condemning pseudo-astrologers. The chapters on Omens give a great deol of useful information, if man is careful in noting them when he goes out, he will be forewarned about the results of his efforts. The author says that (XLVI-2) the evil omens are the results of man’s Karma in previous births and that they are intended to warn him. There is a whole chapter giving various types of the wm? (Arya) metre containing their Ganas and Yatis and also many varieties of Dandakas. Verse (LXVlII-112) is an example of good poetry. The verse is very useful in finding the time that has elapsed since the reign of the I’andavas. But here there is a doubt in the next line of the verse, where he says so many years intervene between Yudhi- shtira and the commencement of the Saka era. Some hold different views regarding this 5r5. Some say that it IX refers to the and others to the But in our opinion, it points to the latter! The chapter entitled I^^r5<r25y was composed by one forms part of the ngmsar. Manu is said to be one of the 18 ancient authors of Samhita. In itself, Manu's authority is recognised. This shows that Manu was a very ancient sage. The author quotes a number of authorities in this Science: Parasara, Garga, Vriddha Garga, Kasyapa, Narada, Pitamaha Siddhanta, Saura Siddhanta, Paulisa Siddhanta, Vasishta Siddhanta, Romaka Siddhanta Vishnugupta, Asita, Devala, Rishiputra, Sukra (Bhrigu or Usanas), Maya, Brihaspati, Saka, Garutman, Saptarshi, Badarayana, Nagnajit, Saraswata, Savitra (a work)’ Shashtyabda (a work ?), Manu, Viswakarman, Vajra, Sri Dravyavardhana, Eharadwaja. Kapila and Kanabhuk In other works of his, the author quotes the following sld*- Satyacharya or Bhadatta, Manittha, Devaswamin, dhasena, Yavanacharya, Jeevasannan, Latacharya, Sim- hacharya; and Aryabhata- Some hold the view that Garga and Vriddha Garga are one and the same per^n. But in Xlll-q and XLVIII.2, he mentions Vriddha Garga by name. The quotations of Bhattopala, the commentator, also prove that they are different persons. C/. XXXI. Vriddha Garga is referred to in the Mahabharata also. We are of opinion that they are different. The which is otherwise known as f contains almost the same chapters with the same titles. In this work, there is a chapter entitled gnstro dealing with the Yugas- Asita B X who was a great astronomer cast the horoscope of the Buddha according to Ilieuntsang. Kasyapa also was a very ancient sage, who does not mention the Romakas at all. From this work, it appears quite clear that had already written his acrfsci?r and the f (I-1 0) According to hiin, the ?rTr (H ora) should treat of horo- scopy, questions about journey and inairiage. The 'iTi* ftT'jfrr'-{or which is bas;.'1 (Oil the five Sidlh.intis his been published with an English translation by G- Thibut in ld83 IT e seems to ii ive written two other big works, namely Rrihat Yatra arid Rrihat Vivah.ipatahi- He lies also written three sin dlcr editions of tlicse, viz (-~5 ?) and The IBrihat Jataka is very famous. Rhattopda has commented upon it. One also seems t(0 have written a commentary con it. .'Mbiruni speaks of a commentary on it by 'irC'SiTf (Balabhadra). This Balabludra has written an inde¬ pendent astrological work from which extracts are quoted in the pages of jatakaparijata. The which is also ecommented upon by Bhattotpala has been trans¬ lated into Arabic by Albiruni as already stated above. Only two chapters of this are now available. The according to Utpala cantains 14 chapters. Dr. Kern has said that;a manuscript copy of this work was with him. The copy now available has only 7 chapters and goes under the name of It is not complete eitiner* Hence we may conclude that it might be the We know nothingiabout the author’s Owing to its utter absence, the commentator has probably in- XI troduced a chapter by The author has writ¬ ten a which is known to us only from the quotations of the learned commentator. The author’s son (Prithuyasas) was also a "reat astrologer- He has written the and ficWR as far as we know. The latter is a very useful work giving many new ideas and has been utilised by Mantreswara in his Phaladeepika especially in respect of Ashtaka Varga, (vide page 265 of that work). The present work has the commentary of Bhattot- pala which is very exhaustive and helpful. It gives valuable quotations from many ancient authorities and the other works of the author. At the end of his coni' mentary on the Brihat Jataka, he says that he finished his commentary on Thursday# the 5th day of the Bright half of the month of Chaitra in 888 of the Saka era-956 A. D. He has commented upon the and also the of Ilis scholarship was deep and vast. He seems to have written a work in 75 stanzas. He has also written a work-^(?5N'!tt (see P. 439)- He was well acquainted with all the ancient works on Astrology, Astronomy, Poetics, etc He is very frank. Where he is ignorant, he openly owns that. For e.xample, in perfumery, he says his knowledge is very meagre. He holds our author in the highest esteem- Scholars all over the world should be grateful to this commentator for his having preserved by his quotations *According to one tradition, this is Varahamihira himself as he was living in the Vindhyas before he went to the Royal Court. XU many authors in this field whose works are now lost. We are not pioneers in presenting an English translation of this great work. Before us, Dr. Kern and Chidam- bara Iyer have translated it. But those editions are not available now. Moreover, they are deficient in some respects. They do not also give the translation by the side of the text. We too might have nodded in certain places in spite of our care and scrutiny ; for, we arc also human beings and this is a very big work wliose publication has necessarily extended over a long period. We have given notes under the translation wherever necessary and not grouped the notes in an appendix to avoid the reader being put to inconvenience by referring to the concerned pages- The author says at the end of the work, the course of the work and the Slokas it contains. Here Sloka means a in'*! or 32 syllables. It may not be out of jilace here if we tell the reaoers that in spite of the heavy cost of printing and paper, the price of this book has been kept sufficiently low in order to enable all classes of readers to have easy access to it. We take this opportunity to record our heartfelt thank* fulness to Mr. V. 13. Srikantaiya, Proprietor, Messrs. V. B. Soobiah & Sons, Printers, for printing tins huge work promptly in a spirit of cordial co-operation and service to the Goddess of Learning, in spite of the scarcity of labour and consequent hardships.

II Introductory. 3r^T% I ii?ii Sloka 1.—The Sun who is the procreator of the Universe, who is the supreme being (soul of the Universe), who is the natural ornament of the sky and who is adorned with rows of thousands of rays that resemble molten gold, is flourishing supreme. iRli Sloka 2.—Being convinced of the correctness and truth of the voluminous science expounded by Brahma (the first sage), I now begin to write this scientific work explaining clearly its ideas in a way which is neither too brief, nor too copious. IRII Sloka 3.—Simply because this ancient work was composed by a sage, it should be good, while that written by an ordinary man of the present day could not be so. When the sense conveyed in both the cases is the same, while the words used alone are different, why should 2 [Adh. I. SI. 4-5 there be any distinction between the two as it is a non-Vedic subject ? The translation of a Vedic passage into any langunga is not as sanctified as the original though the sense may be the same as the former lacks the (Sabda) or the sound of the original* JT I sri n^n Sloha 4.—It has been declared by our grand father (Sage Brahma) that the day of the week belonging to Mars—that is Tuesday—is not auspicious. People of our generation have also stated that the week day of Mars will not prove good (for beginning or doing any function). Wherein is the special merit in the two declarations of man and God ? Sloka 5.—Looking into the vastness of the science that has emanated from Brahma and others and its being epitomised gradually by successive sages, I also take pleasure in writing this work in a brief manner. This science viz,, Astronomy-cum-Astrology was created by Brahman himself as ancillary to the Vedas. It was handed down from him to 'nr (Gurga) and other sages. Cf- Iw wu't? il 5««95g i II ?flr. Adh. I. SI. 6-7] JWjftssani; 3 ^nri'rf l ^iri ll^ii Sloka 6.—Originally, there was only darkness pervading throughout the universe. Then came water. From it sprang a blazing golden egg consisting of the two parts of the shell, viz., the earth and the firmament. Out of this, it is said, arose Brahman, the creator, with the Sun and the Moon for his eyes.

SI. 8-9 Sloha 7.—Sage Kapila has declared s^R-Pradhana (the unmanifested Prakriti) to be the material cause of the universe, while Sage Kanada—who was the founder of the atomic theory relating to the origin of the Universe—has described the Dravyas—the nine sub¬ stances—as the material cause. Some have opined that time is the cause of the universe. There are others who say that the universe was produced and is sustained by the natural and necessary action of substances according to their inherent properties (and not by the agency of a supreme being). Lastly, there are people who state that the actions—good or bad—of the beings are the cause of the universe. SlokaS.—Enough of this incidental discourse on a polemical and vast subject, and which, if it were to be discussed, would swell to a very great length and te of no avail to us for the present. I am now going to treat in a decisive manner of the principles of the science of Astrology—Jyotissastra—and the ancillary topics. HR ilHTH: 1 Sloka 9.—The science of Astrology consists of various branches and is in three sections or Skandhas— viz., *iPRl-Ganita, qltr-Hora and W<sr-Sakha, and the treatment of the subject in its entirety is termed by sages Adh, I. SI 10.11] jro;^Vs«m?T: 5 w^frr-Samhita (compilation or collection). The first or section where the exact movements, etc., of the planets in the several signs of the zodiac are ascer¬ tained through mathematical computation is otherwise known as a-^-Tantra. fforoscopy is another section ; »tJFr^(5f«?I-Angavinischaya cr locating precisely the cor¬ rect position of the Lagna, etc., which is the first step in wa^i%4-Jatakakarma is the .3rd. »Tn: ^Tfoia m fsagf i ^ II?®II Sloka, 10.—-By me have been treated in detail in the (Karana Grantha) (Pancha Siddhanthika), of retrograde and direct motions of the several (non-luminous) planets from Mars onwards, their disappearance (eclipse) through proximity to the Sun, and their reappearance or emerging after conjunction with the Sun, their state of being at war or planetary fight. All things connected with horoscopy along with births, journeys, marriages, etc., have been already treated of in my previous works. This shows that Varahamihira had already written Brihat Jataka, Yatra, etc. iiuii Sloka 11.—Omitting queries and their respective answers which are not highly useful for our purpose, and also the origin of the planets and other unessential discussions, I am going to treat of real facts—the quint¬ essence of everything that is useful. 6 [Adh. If. 1-3 I li^ti The Astrologer. mW* I We shall now comment upon the aphorisms relating to an astrologer:— I xin: gqi i 2. The astrologer should be of noble descent, good-looking, modest in disposition, truthful, free from malice, impartial, with well-proportioned limbs all perfect and unimpaired, strong joints, undeformed, with fine hands, feet, nails, eyes, chin, teeth, ears, forehead, eye-brows and head, with handsome physique and a voice deep and sonorous. For, merits and demerits are generally the reflection.s of good and bad physical features.* * Cf. Kuraara Sambhava-Canto V—36. 'n^H 'Tf'Tf H I h ?f5r 3«>n: i jrf^^TRWi^ 3. The following are the good qualities of an astrologer. He must be clean and active, bold and Adh. II, 4] 7 eloquent, have readiness of wit, fully conversant with the details of the place and time and sincere in dispo¬ sition. He should not be timid in an assembly, should not be overpowered by his fellow studfents, must be well, trained, should understand the heart of others, should be free from vices, must be conversant with the art of propitiation, with hygiene, magic and ablutions, should be engaged in the worship of the Devas, should be an observer of fast and penance, should be endowed with great power resulting from the wonderful achievements of his scientific knowledge, should be capable of answering questions put by others, and voluntarily suggesting palliatives and remedies regarding things other than the visitations of God. He should also be thoroughly conversant with works dealing with calculations of the positions, etc., of planets, Samhita, Horoscopy and the;.r several details. 4. In that astronomical science, there are five schools, viz., Paulisa (belonging to Pulisa), Romaka (a Siddhanta, probably derived from the Romans), Vasishtha (belonging to Vasishta), Saura (belonging to Surya), Paitamaha (or Brahma Siddhanta), that is Siddhanta by Brahmagupta. In these are treated of all about Yuga, year, Ayana, Ritu, Masa, Paksha (fortnight). Day, Night, Yama, Muhurtha, Nadee, Prana, Thruti and its further subdivisions of time, and the astrologer should be con¬ versant with all these and also with the ecliptic. 8 [Adh. 11^7 5. He should also be familiar with the four kinds of measurements of time, viz., ^tf.solar ; worst, a duratibn (day) intervening between the first rising of any particular planet or star and its corresponding next rising ; stellar calculation in terms of lunar months, Tithis, etc., with the occurrence of Adhimasa or inter¬ calary lunations and intercalary days. A wfr <^fty is the interval between one snn-rise and the succeeding one. A or terrestrial day is the interval between two contiguous risings of the Sun at the Equator. Thirty such days constitute a month, JTIitlsn'tfT is the time taken by the Moon to clear a Star, A consists of 30 lunar Tithis and is a period intervening between two snccessitfe conjunctions of the Moon with the Sun, An Adhika Masa is a period of a lunar month occurring between two solar Sankramanas in the same Rasi. For this and see Suryasiddnanta. 6. He should be familiar with the computation of the commencement and termination times of the 60 year-period, the Yuga (5 year-period), a year, a month, a day, an hour and also of their respective lords. There are 12 Yugas or five-year periods in a cycle of 60 years and their lords are stated as follows : ftisg: wg5nT«rif!aWTC‘r^?nrOT?.n^'iar i af^nr: ii ^^^5: I Adh. II. 8-10] 9 In the case of the several systems of measurements of time, viz,. Solar, Savana, Lunar, etc., he must be able to distinguish what are similar and what are not similar; and also be conversant with the aptness or otherwise of each for (being used for) any particular purpose. 8 In cases of difference of opinion among the Siddhantas regarding the actual termination of an Ayana, he should be able to reconcile them by showing the agreement between accurate calculation and what has been actually observed in the circle drawn on the ground through shadow and water-appliances. orn^i^j I 9. He should also he conversant with the causes that lead the planets from the Sun onwards to proceed in different kinds of motions—rapid, slow, southerly, northerly, towards apojee, perijee, etc. Vide Sripatipaddhati—P.48. 10 In the matter of the Solar and Lunar eclipses, he should be able to predict by calculation the times of their commencement, cessation, direction, magnitude, duration, intensity and color as well as the Moon’s prospective conjunctions with the non-luminous planets and their warfare. ?. . 0 2 io [Adh. ir. 11-13 I 11. He should in the case of every planet be able to calculate its distance (in Yojana) from the Earth, the length of its orbit, etc. 12. He should be familiar with the Earth’s rotation (in its own axis) round the Sun and also with its revolution in the stellar firmament, its shape and the like, the latitude (of a place) and its complement, the difference in the lengths of the day and night, the Chara Khandas of a place, the rising periods of the several signs at any place, the methods of conversion from shadow to time and time to shadow, to find the exact period—elapsed ghatikas since Sun-rise or Sun-set—at any required time from the position of the Sun or from the Lagna as the case may be. For Cbarakhaodas, see Sripatipaddbati PP-157-160- 13. He is a true astrologer who is able to under¬ stand the objections and points of differences and meet them in clear and convincing language thus proving the truth of the science in its pristine purity in the same way as separating pure gold by bringing it under the touch-stone, fire, hammer, etc., and enabling it to retain its pure value.

All the above subjects are treated of in Brihat Jataka and Vivaha Patala—T^^lfTsw. This latter work is not by Varaha- mihira but by one author called another great astro¬ loger, who has written on Muhurta for marriage and so on. [See Adhyaya 103 infra} 15.

And all the above should be divined by an astrologer every moment with a single-minded devotion. And it is not possible for a single person to comprehend all these occurring day and night. Hence an astrologer in the employ of a king should engage four efficient assistants for the task, each to be in charge of two directions, thus: one to observe east, and south-east, a second for the south and south-west, a third for the west and north-west, and the fourth for the north and north-east. By this, it will be possible for noting clearly the fall of meteors and the like which is sudden in its nature and one’s good and bad effects have to be predicted through the form, color, viscidity, size, etc., of these falling bodies and as to how they dash or strike against the otlier planets and stars.

T%i%j 11^11 Slokas 2-3.—At present, one course of the Sun begins from the commencement of Karkataka and the other from the beginning of Makara. That it is different from what has been stated above can easily be ascertained by direct observation. By marking every day the position of an object situ- ated at a distance at the time of the rising or setting of the Sun, or watching the entry and exit of the brim of the shadow of a stick placed at the centre of a big circle drawn on the Earth, the difference iti the Sun’s course may be detected. ||«ii Sloha 4.—When the Sun retraces his steps before he has reached Makara and changes his direction, he destroys the West and the South.

And even sages, emaciated being stricken with hunger, for¬ saking their usual religious duties and good conduct will be emigrating with great difficulty to other countries, having in their arms infants—mere skeletons—without flesh due to want of food. Good men will be robbed of their entire wealth by thieves and will be heaving long sighs ; and their eye-lids will be drooping and bodies, languid ; and their eyes will be obstructed by tears due to sorrow.

Slolia 18.—If the Sun’s disc be obscured by obstacles in the form of a king’s paraphernalia such as umbrella, chowrie, banner, etc., it indicates a change of a sovereign. If the Sun be hidden by sparks of fire, smoke, etc., it forebodes the destruction of people. Sloha 19.—If there should be one single object in the Sun’s disc, it denotes the advent of famine.

If the colour of the Sun’s upward rays be variegated or misty and if there should be no immediate rain following, it causes chaos and disaster to the country through thieves, clash of weapons, etc. Now he speaks of the Sun’s colour in the different seasons : iR»ii S8 [Adh.

In the Varsha Ritu, it will “be whitish ; in Sarad Ritu, the colour will be that of the interior of the lotus ; and in the Hemanta Ritu, it will be blood-red, and the effect on mankind will be all auspicious.

He asked God Brahma to confer ou him the status of a planet, immortality, victory over the Gods and power to devour tie two luminaries. At this, the Lord spoke smilingly thus : “ You will find it extremely hard to digest these two ; still, be it so. ” So saying, the Lord, vanished. Then Rahu rushed at them. Then God Vishnu hurled his discus, chopped hi8 head off and said, “ Let the creator’s words however, not go to waste. In your respective two periods you may devour the luminaries and thereby indicate good and bad things for the world*” n^li SloJca 3—One school of learned men says that Rahu—son of Simhika—is of a serpentine form with only the face and the tail; while another class maintains that he is formless and of the nature of pure darkness. tt^i: i Tt gff ct*ir -g ?Tf: wr i a*ii g ear^9r<iT^ i sTTsarafaftlr wwiSir fcfRqti ti 4^ [Adh.

Add 8539 to the product and divide the result by 3750. To the quotient thus obtained, add the Saka years. Divide this by 60 and the remain¬ der thereof by 5. The quotient represents the five-year- periods ruled by Vishnu and others, and the renaainder denotes the number of years that have elapsed in the particular lustrum. irj^ii Sloka 22.—Place the years of Jupiter obtained in the previous Sloka separately in two places. Multiply the first by 9 and divide the other by 12. Add the above product (in the first case) and the quotient (in the second case). Divide the result by 4. The quotient will reveal the particular asterism reckoned from Dhanishta. The remainder will denote the Padas (T(^) in the next star that have been traversed by Jupiter. In a Mahayuga (the period comprising the four Yugas), the number of solar years is 4320000 = 3750 x 1152 * 4370640 That of Jupiter for the same period is as per Surya 4370688"=3794 X 1152 Siddhanta. 96 [Adh. VIII. SI. 22 So that for every 3750 salar years we have 3794 years of Jupiter. 44 Therefore 1 solar year=l+j^^ years of Jupiter. To find out the number of Jupiter years that had elapsed fin Kaliyuga) at the time of the commencement of the Salivahana era, we have to proceed thus; The number of solar years that have passed from the beginning of Kaliyuga till the commencement of the Saka era is 3179. This converted into Jupiter years will be X 3179 or 3216 —^ Now it is known that Kaliyuga commenced in the year Vijaya (the 27th year from Prabhava, which is the first year in a cycle of 60 years of Jupiter). Therefore, 3216 + 26 or 3242 being divided by 60^ the remainder will give the particular year of Jupiter (in his cycle of 60 years) from Prabhava at the time of commencement of the Saka * 1126 era, and this remainder is 2 which is the 3rd year or the year Sukla of the cycle. Coming down to the period subsequent to the commencement of the Saka era, say the present time (^VisT ^tsfi-Vartamana Saka 1868 April 1945), the number of Jupiter years that have elapsed will be 1867 + —+ 2 from the beginning of Prabhava or 1867 + 21 + 2 or 1891 which indicates that it is the 32nd year of the cycle or Vilambi. But actually, it is Hemalamba. The reason is that the figures for Jupiter's years as given by Aryabhatta or as per Surya-siddhanta are a bit more than that of Varahamihira. His figure 8589 appearing in Sloka 20 is different from 8626 that we got above. Calculating backwards from 8589, we find the number of siderial revolutions of Jupiter according to Varahamihira to be 364190000. This is probably thft correct figure. Sloka 22 gives a clue to find out the particular lunar mansion in which Jupiter may happen to be at any given time. Adh. VIII. SI. 23-24] 97 Taking the current Saka year 1868, we have the Saka years that have elapsed as 1867. The number of Jupiter years that have elapsed as calculated in the penultimate paragraph’of page 96 will be 774 1891 This when divided by 60 gives a quotient 31. As per Sloka 22, we have to multiply the above quotient 31 by 9 ; then we get 279 ; and by dividing the same quotient by 12 7. 7 . . . we get 2-^2 Adding these two figures we get 281^. Dividing this result by 4 we get 70 and odd, thus indicating the asterism traversed by Jupiter, as the 17th. This when reckoned from Dhanishta is Uttaraphalguni.

The spectroscope has pretty well solved the query. It consists, first, of a more or less solid nucleus of fire, blazing and glowing ; second, of vast masses of incandescent gas, constituting the luminous head; third, solid materials, constituting the tail, which are ponderable, which reflect the Sun’s light and are carried along by the influence of the nucleus ; fourth, an immense prolongatioH of the tail in the nature of attenuated volumes of gas. The solid materials of a comet, it ia believed, consist of stones and s^hkI, particle.s ground by ceaseless attrition The proof of ■ this is the concession of most astronomers that meteoric showers are slici-ds and patches of cometic matter, dropped Irotn the tail, and these meleots are Slones. The genesis of comets is found to be in the explosion of planetary bodies, a theory not without good scientific authority. A rage estimates that there lare 17,000,000 'of these fiery wan¬ derers within the orbit of Neptune, and Lambert regards 500.000,000 as a moderate estimate for those in the solar system. All the astronomers agree that they are scattered through space as ^srofuse'y as tin- fisli in the .soas.

The assumption made by certain commentators that <1^ should invariably refer to Vikrama Saka (56 B. C.) does not seem to be altogether correct. For, it i.9 said in the Mahabharata that Kali set in soon after Krishna’s departure. This should be 3102 B. C. Hence the age of Yudhishtira should be somewhere at the earlier part of the 32nd century before Christ. Subtracting 2526 from this figure we find that.the Saka referred to in the Slokashould be in the 7th Century B. C. (far earlier than the age of the Buddha —5th century B. C.).

With reference to our Puranas, it can be ascertained that 3n^i;rT-Jaiiibudw0epa (one of the seven continents surrounding the mountain Meru) was divided into nine sub-oontinents each being termed a ^T Varsha. These nine divisions are Cl)ir?‘ Kuru (2) rtcvJTTlAirantnaya (3) c^gti'Ramyika (4) Ilavrita (5) fl^Hari (6) ^ja'Ssr-KetumaU (7) Bhadraswa (8) l^^r^-Kinnara and (9) *tIC^-Bharata. The name of the Adhyaya suggests in itse f that the word "^S'-Kiirma in¬ stead of being literally translated as ‘tortoise’ should bs con¬ strued to mean ‘Globe.’ This is further supported by the first Sloka of the chapter which St irts with nine divisions of the 27 lunar mansions—'each division consisting of 3 stars commencing from Krittika. The reader will note that the origin-al divisions of the zodiac started from the fir;t quarter of Krittikii the star owned by the Sun, the lord of the nine planets. That our ancient authors went hand in hand with a tborougk knowledge of the 18 Puranas is another reason for us to interpret as Globe.

Dr. Kern remarks in his foot notes; ‘*Il is not known which source has been chiefly used by our author in this particular instance ; thus much, however, is certain, that long before his time (ircck horoscopy had been introduced into India, By Varahamihira certainly refers to Garga.Para- sara and a host of other Hindu astrologers as he {has consistently been doing in all his works, bio doubt, Yavana lived before Varahamihira and that Greek astrology was not unknown in India in his time. But to say that this idea about Varsha and Masa Phalas has been introduced into India by Yavana is .certainly in¬ correct as sages who lived in India ages before have freely spoken about these. It may safely be said that ancient sages of India like 196 [Adh. XIX. SI. 1.3 Garga, Parasara, etc., have known all about these and that Varahamihira perfected all these things in his Samhita as promised, knowing also that Yavanacharya also has known all about these. It may not be out of place to bring to the notice of the readers that Maharshi Parasara, the father of the celebrated Vyasa, popu¬ larly known as ^i«Tre-Vedavyasa, existed far before the advent of Kali (^1%), that is, the fourth millennium B. C., and that for a sage of this repute, it is not correct to conclude that Parasara had to learn everything from the West. What I want to impress is that our ancient sages who were founders of the Six Angas of the Vedas, did not require any foreign agency to put them in the way, but that they were in themselves, each a mine of knowledge. Further, to support my statement that Indian culture existed earlier than the Greeks, I quote below the following line from Raghuvamsa:— < 51 ti«nRrfc5if5^?rTft ii?ii IR.I \W\ Shlcas 1-3.—The state of things in a year, month or day presided over by the Sun will be as follows : every¬ where, the earth is covered with very little crop, the Adh.

During the period when Jupiter and Saturn occupy a single sign of the zodiac, there would be pestilence, cholera and death among the people. As long as Jupiter and Venus continue together in a state of disappearance, mankind will suffer from devils, diseases, thieves and enemies. If the course of Saturn or the retrograde motion of Mars should lie through the signs of Dhanus, Mesha, Vrishabha, l.leena or Simha, there wouid be such deaths among men and animals that only a third of mankind, of elephants, horses, cows and other animals of birds and of creatures of water would survive. If the motion of Mars should be an accelerated one, there would be fear from destructive fires: if he should retrograde and enter another sign, the people would suffer from heat aud many families would suffer, and if his course should be through a sign longer than the calculated period, there would bo drought in the land and rulers will beat war. If Jupiter should retrograde or if his motion should be an accelerated one, and if in this state ho should enter another sign, the rivers would not be full ; the kings would lose their glory and suffer from diseases. If Saturn should, after a long direct course, begin to retro¬ grade or have an accelerated motion and in this state enter another sign, there would he diseases, famine and drought in the land and vehicles wil 1 suffer destruction. If, when Jupiter should enter another sign when in his acce¬ lerated motion, Saturn should be in his slow motion, Venus should have disappeared, and Mercury should have reappeared, the country would perish. If Saturn, Mars and Jupiter should be within sight of each other, men with their children would suffer from hunger and from weapons. I 48 378 [Adh. XLVTI. SI. 28. If, while the course of the Sun lies through the end of the signs Vrishabha, Mithuna, Vrischika and Siinha, Jupiter and Mars should be in conjunction with it, mankind would suffer from famine, and the deaths would be so many that in the cremation grounds of villages and towns, Pisacha* might be seen with hundreds cf dead bodies in their mouths. If two, three or four planets should meet together, people would suffer from death and famine. If five planets should meet, there would also be famine; if six, the chief ruler would run away from his kingdom, and if seven, humanity would come to an end. If the course of Mars and Saturn, through the signs of Kar- kataka, Simha and Meena should be retrograde or re^retrograde, there would he much suffering on earth. There would also be a scarcity of water and wars in the land; grains would be des¬ troyed and mankind would suffer from robbers. If Saturn and Kahu should meet, crops would be injured; commodity would become scarce; husbands and wives would be at strife, there would be drought and f.imine in the land : cows would suffer death and men would become exceedingly lazy. If the course of the Sun and the Moon, both of brilliant discs, should lie through the seven astcrisms ronr Krittika, Madhya- desa would suffer miseries. If the course of the Sun, the Moon, Mars and Venus should lie through the seven iisterisms from Magha, there would be grief and disease among men and the God of Death would be busy in his wide work of destruction in the southern countries. If the course of Jupiter, the Moon and Mercury, all of brilliant discs, should lie through the seven asterisms from Anuradha, the western countries, as far as the sea, as well as the western sea itself with its creatures would suffer miseries. If the course of the Sun. Venus and .Mars should lie through tlie seven asterisms from Sravishta, the northern countries would suffer miseries. If the beneftc planets should appear of the colour of gold, the Brahmins, the Kshatriyas, the Vaisyas and the Sudras would all attend to their respective duties and would becom happy.” Thus ends the 47th .\dhyaya on “ Motley Misoellany.”.

But it will be seen that the author has himself referred to this subject, , Anga Vidya, in Adhyaya n siipm (P.15, lines 2, 3). Sloka 1.—An astrologer should predict good anil bad effects on observing carefully the direction, speedily place and articles brought .at the time, also taking into consideration the behaviour of thetimbs of the questioner with reference to himself or to another person and the particular time of his query. For, Time which is Om¬ niscient, All-powerful, and All-seeing, on account of its being the Soul (sustainer) of ail beings—moveable and stationary—shows good and bad effects through the bodily movements and utterances of the querists* Slola 2.—The place favourable for a query is one which is even (without depressions and elevations), covered with the shade of trees that smile with flowers, are laden with fruits, have glossy barks and leaves, are devoid,of ill-omened birds and bear auspicious names; which is the abode of Gods, sages* Brahmins, virtuqus men and Siddhas, which is endowed with fragrant A4b.

The pre¬ diction may also be made by observing the articles brought at the time by others, what is in front of the querist, or what is in his hand or on his clothes. f^T I VD # II? oil Slokas 8-10.—The following are tin; masculine limbs: thighs, lips, breasts, testicles, feet, teeth, arm^ hands, cheeks, hairs, throat, nails, thumbs, the frontal bone, armpits, shoulders, the ears, the anus and the joints.

If the querist should touch a limb of the first group, the success of the task should be achieved immediately ; if a limb of the second group, the success will be delayed, while in the last group, it is improbable. Even in the case of the limbs of the first two groups, if they are coarse, injured, cut or lean, success will not be achieved. 3rf5^t imt II??

When he strikes the head, there will be trouble from the King.

Great kings can have mansions of storeys; Brahmins, of 7j ; Ksliatriyas, of 6|; Vaisyas, of ; and Sudras, of 3i. The height of Sudra’s house ought not to exceed 20 moderate cubits; that of Vaisya’s, 40 cubits; that of Kshatriya's, 60 culuts; that of Brahmin's, SO cubits ; and that of' king’s, 100 cubits. The last is themaximani limit for the height of human habitations. According to the same authority, the height of the founda¬ tions of best houses is to be 2h cubits. There is restriction re.arding the heiglit of th; storeys of buildings with two, three and four halls. In a house of a single hall, the height is equal to its breadth. According to another authority, vis Sakra, the width of single- hailed houses is not restricted; but it should not exceed the length. Should it exceed th-^ length, such houses would be called Utsargas. But single-hailed houses are not prescribed for Brah- irlins, etc. Such houses are not conducive to longevity, but if made of straw, they can bs permitted(Garga).

Viswa- karman opines that in the construction of houses, etc., the first kind of digit should be adopted; of beds, eating plates, vehicles, etc., the last variety. The combination of old and new bricks, baked and raw ones, etc., is forbidden. But Hiranyagarbha says: if necessary, raw bricks should be used below, and than baked ones. Maya objects to this and states :—There are five things to be done for houses ; viz., Katima, Granthima, Ilayima, Ripima and Khatima. Hiranya¬ garbha says : There are different kinds of houses according to the materials used in the construction* One built of stone is called Mandira; of baked bricks, Vastu : this is the best; of raw bricks, Sumanta ; of mud, Sudhara; of wooden logs, Mana- sya; of bamboos, Nandana; of canvas for kings, Vjjaya; of vari¬ eties of straw, Kalima. For house-holders the best houses are those made of gold, silver, copper and iron. They are respectively called Pushkara, Sribhava, Suryamanta and Chanda. There are also four other varieties, vtz., those made of lac, Anila, tin and Varibandhaka Thus there are fourteen varieties of houses in all categories.

Just as there are, veins in the human body, even so do they exist, some higher up, others lower down, in the earth. The water that falls fro;n the sky with the same colour and taste, assumes various colours and tastes owing to the difference in the nature of trte earth.
